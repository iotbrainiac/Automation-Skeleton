all the setting up of esp01, esp12 and esp32 goes here.
esp01 is a 3v3 logic chip(/module).esp12 is used from a wemos board.And the "ESP32 DEV KIT" board is used for esp32.
The setting up of the esp01 and esp12 are pretty much the same and easy.The boards must be installed in the boards list in the arduino IDE.
